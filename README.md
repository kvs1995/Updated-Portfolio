  Learn about me and see how my coding knowledge has grown as I utilize CSS and HTML to create a fun responsive portfolio. This includes a brief biography of how I got into this field, as well as what projects I have under my belt. I hope that it gives you a sense of who I am and why I love creating these websites so much!
